I had a blast. Montreal, thank you for treating us well.

We got to demo two of our visualization projects for the National Energy Board (NEB) and had a great response.

I also participated in the workshops 'Data Visualization on Mobile Devices' and 'Rethinking Interaction'. I really enjoyed the discussions on interaction paradigms and got great feedback on my thoughts on multiple views and interaction. Also, Katherine Currier mastered her presentation of our work on in-situ mobile visualization design.

Now, I am looking forward to getting back to my loved ones.
