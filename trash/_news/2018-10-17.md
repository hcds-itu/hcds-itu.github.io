Berlin here we come. Look forward to spending time discussing visualization research with fellow colleagues form around the world.

Tina Huynh will be presenting our poster on considering multiple views as menus. Look forward to the response to this work.

Also, I will drop by Copenhagen and Aarhus afterwards for a quick visit and talk on multiple views and about VIVIR.
