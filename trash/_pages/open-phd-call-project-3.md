IT literacy is an essential skill in our times and, given the dynamism of the IT domain, programming-related
learning is likely to become a life-long activity for many. Since there are disproportionately more students of
programming than teachers, a great challenge in education will be the ability to assess and meet each student
at their skill level and to provide suitable exercises, content, and feedback.

This Ph.D. project aims to develop novel technologies that will help people understand their own, their peers,
and their students' programming skills and weaknesses. The project will develop tools for the continuous
assessment of skill level. This will be achieved by monitoring and analyzing the source code committed by
learners to version control systems, a technique from the field of mining software repositories. Visualization
tools strived at helping users understand and monitor skills will be designed based on the scholarship of
teaching and learning as well as the techniques that have emerged from information visualization (InfoVis) and
the related field of software visualization.

The resulting tools and techniques will foster scaffolded self-evaluation and problem-solving skills for all
students of programming, with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of IT education for students and
educators worldwide.
