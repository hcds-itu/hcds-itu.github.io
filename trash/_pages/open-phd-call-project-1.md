The current pandemic and global warming crises have emphasized the need for contemporary democratic
societies to be able to engage in data-informed public debates. Contemporary societies collect increasing
amounts of data to allow policy makers to make informed decisions. However, current technologies lack ways
for different stakeholders to take part in these decisions on similar terms.

This PhD aims to contribute visualization technologies that enable people to partake in data-based discussions,
with the aim to improve democratic processes rather than pave the way for technocracy. Doing so, we build on
prior work on collaborative and social visualization to identify shortcomings when considered in the context of
argumentation and disagreement.

During the project, we will study technologies in societal use, and we will create novel technologies that support
in-person and online data debate. To create a rich understanding of the phenomena that might be involved in
data debates, we will first conduct studies in our lab that construct close-to natural situations where
participants engage in in-person data discussions based on data visualizations. We will also study how people
use existing tools to participate in online data discussions in parallel to our lab-based efforts and compare the
insight from our two approaches. We plan to use our study insights to identify promising directions for designing
new visualization techniques and technologies for online, interactive, data-based discussions and will explore
possibilities for evaluating these in lab studies and studies that offer higher degrees of external validity.
