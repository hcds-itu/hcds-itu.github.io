      <p>In this article, we present PixelClipper, a tool built for facilitating data engagement events. PixelClipper supports conversations around visualizations in public settings through annotation and commenting capabilities. It is recognized that understanding data is important for an informed society. However, even when visualizations are available on the web, open data is not yet reaching all audiences. Public facilitated events centered around data visualizations may help bridge this gap. PixelClipper is designed to promote discussion and engagement with visualizations in public settings. It allows viewers to quickly and expressively extract visual clippings from visualizations and add comments to them. Ambient and facilitator displays attract attention by showing clippings. They function as entry points to the full visualizations while supporting deeper conversations about the visualizations and data. We describe the design goals of PixelClipper, share our experiences from deploying it, and discuss its future potential in supporting data visualization engagement events.</p>

      <p>We explore design opportunities for varying visual complexity of information visualizations based on distance. Through considering visual congruency and proxemics interaction, we describe a design space that considers potential transitions between visualizations in relation to distance. Our design space is based on exploring prototyping and design possibilities. It describes three properties (boundedness, connectedness, and cardinality) and five design patterns (subdivision, particalization, peculiarization, multiplication, and nesting) that might be considered in design. We describe our design ideas and prototypes, as well as reflect on their usefulness. Finally, we discuss limitations and implications of our work.</p>

      <p>We reflect on our experiences as designers of COVID-19 data visualizations working in a distributed synchronous design space during the pandemic. This is especially relevant as the pandemic posed new challenges to distributed collaboration amidst civic lockdown measures and an increased dependency on spatially distributed teamwork across almost all sectors. Working from home being‚Äôthe new normal‚Äô, we explored potential solutions for collaborating and prototyping remotely from our own homes using the existing tools at our disposal. Since members of our cross-disciplinary team had different technical skills, we used a range of synchronous remote design tools and methods. We aimed to preserve the richness of co-located collaboration such as face-to-face physical presence, body gestures, facial expressions, and the making and sharing of physical artifacts. While meeting over Zoom, we sketched on paper and used digital collaboration tools, such as Miro and Google Docs. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, we articulate our challenges and strategies throughout the process, providing useful insights about synchronous distributed collaboration.</p>

      <p>INTRODUCTION. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic unveiled a strong need for advanced and informative surveillance tools. The Centre for Health Informatics (CHI) at the University of Calgary took action to develop a surveillance dashboard, which would facilitate the education of the public, and answer critical questions posed by local and national government. OBJECTIVES. The objective of this study was to create an interactive method of surveillance, or a ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Tracker‚Äù for Canadian use. The Tracker offers user-friendly graphics characterizing various aspects of the current pandemic (e.g. case count, testing, hospitalizations, and policy interventions). METHODS. Six publicly available data sources were used, and were selected based on the frequency of updates, accuracy and types of data, and data presentation. The datasets have different levels of granularity for different provinces, which limits the information that we are able to show. Additionally, some datasets have missing entries, for which the ‚Äúlast observation carried forward‚Äù method was used. The website was created and hosted online, with a backend server, which is updated on a daily basis. The Tracker development followed an iterative process, as new figures were added to meet the changing needs of policy-makers. RESULTS. The resulting Tracker is a dashboard that visualizes real-time data, along with policy interventions from various countries, via user-friendly graphs with a hover option that reveals detailed information. The interactive features allow the user to customize the figures by jurisdiction, country/region, and the type of data shown. Data is displayed at the national and provincial level, as well as by health regions. CONCLUSION. The COVID-19 Tracker offers real-time, detailed, and interactive visualizations that have the potential to shape crucial decision-making and inform Albertans and Canadians of the current pandemic.</p>

      <p>We designed and implemented an interactive artistic data visualization of the 11thInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Our visualization primarily showcases the structure of the ICD-11, showing how the different codes fall into the main disease categories (chapters) and subcategories. This is our preliminary approach in the design and study of artistic visualizations for exploring the ICD-11, as well as aid in its awareness campaign.</p>

      <p>The notion of multi-layer networks introduces a general framework and common vocabulary for existing ideas in complex network theory. In doing so, it is possible to understand and compare these dierent ideas in a new and more fruitful manner. However, to make this operationalizable to the visualization and visual analytics community, we need more clarity. For example: What is a layer? What are the semantics of interlayer edges, and specifically, identity links between layers? Can dierent multilayered networks be expressed or implemented in the same way? And vice versa, can one multilayered network be expressed or implemented in dierent ways?</p>

      <p>Complex data visualization design projects often entail collaboration between people with different visualization-related skills. For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.</p>

      <p>We present a visual analytics tool for collaboratively exploring data from patient administrative systems on large touch displays in meeting contexts. Large touch displays are becoming commercially available, but we have limited knowledge about how they might be used in such a context. We investigated this with our system, PatientAdministrativeDataExplorer (PADE). We designed PADE based on inquiries with healthcare data analysts tasked with understanding expenses in a healthcare system that serve about six million residents. Our goals in designing the system were to enable the analysts to collaboratively construct hypotheses, quickly generate and execute strategies, and support ad hoc discussions and Q&amp;A sessions during meetings. We created a set of interaction techniques that let users create new visualizations and combine parts of existing ones, and illustrate these possibilities through an analysis scenario. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and limitations of PADE, its interaction techniques, and future work in this direction.</p>

      <p>We present our preliminary results of an international survey on the practical adoption and use of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) from a visualization and visual analytics perspective. The ICD system, in different versions, is globally used for coding morbidity and mortality statistics, however, coding practices vary across countries. Our survey includes questions about hospital data collection systems, use of features in ICD, and training of ICD coding specialists. Variations in ICD could hinder comparability and limit generalizability of observed findings. Our preliminary results establish the current state of ICD use and training internationally, and will ultimately be valuable to the World Health Organization to further research on how to improve ICD coding, and enhance international comparisons of health data. From a visualization and visual analytics perspective, the current differences in adoption and use of ICD poses challenges and opportunities. For example, when morbidity-data from two countries differ in their coding, can we still compare data from these countries, and if so, then under which circumstances? We discuss how visualization and visual analytics might help in these situations.</p>

      <p>We present Biomole, an interactive visualization designed to explore a data set created to support bio-inspiration design published by the Ask Nature organization. The Ask Nature data set contains a hierarchy of functions which we encode within different visual elements of Biomole; most importantly interactive data painting of functions allows people to search for functional co-occurrence. The movement of the visual elements is a metaphorical nod to the bio-inspired nature of the data and the uncertainty of the design solution space.</p>

      <p>Constructive approaches to visualization authoring have been shown to offer advantages such as providing options for flexible outputs, scaffolding and ideation of new data mappings, personalized exploration of data, as well as supporting data understanding and literacy. However, visualization authoring tools based on a constructive approach do not scale well to larger datasets. As construction often involves manipulating small pieces of data and visuals, it requires a significant amount of time, effort, and repetitive steps. We present ReConstructor, an authoring tool in which a visualization is constructed by instantiating its structural and functional components through four interaction elements (objects, modifiers, activators, and tools). This design preserves most of the benefits of a constructive process while avoiding scalability issues by allowing designers to propagate individual mapping steps to all the elements of a visualization. We also discuss the perceived benefits of our approach and propose avenues for future research in this area.</p>

      <p>We present a visualization that makes use of a novel highlighting and animation technique. The primary motivation behind the design of this visualization was to enable people to look at data about healthcare services, and specifically to increase their knowledge about the impact of the amount of healthcare workers per capita. We use animation in the process of showing changes within an individual country over the course of several years, as well as to facilitate comparisons between multiple countries at once, by letting people keep track of selected countries. We discuss the motivation behind our use of animation, our choice to include a search bar, and potential areas for improvement and revision.</p>

      <p>Data visualizations are often represented in public discourse as objective proof of facts. However, a visualization is only a single translation of reality, just like any other media, representation devices, or modes of representation. If we wish to encourage thoughtful, informed, and literate consumption of data visualizations, it is crucial that we consider why they are often presented and interpreted as objective. We reflect theoretically on data visualization as a system of representation historically anchored in science, rationalism, and notions of objectivity. It establishes itself within a lineage of conventions for visual representations which extends from the Renaissance to the present and includes perspective drawing, photography, cinema and television, as well as computer graphics. By examining our tendency to see credibility in data visualizations and grounding that predisposition in a historical context, we hope to encourage more critical and nuanced production and interpretation of data visualizations in the public discourse.</p>

      <p>Visualization systems with multiple views are often used to represent data from different perspectives. There are many advantages in doing so, such as providing a way for users to understand a dataset by revealing its various attributes in separate views and offering additional information that could be more useful than if it was just one graph. However, this can often make data seem complicated and overwhelming as each view remains independent. We present a visualization that utilizes multiple views as a means for interaction and unifying the different data dimensions of a multi-view system. This creates a cohesive visualization that displays different aspects of the data, in this case, hierarchical text data and numerical data. With this personal data visualization, we offer a potential solution for relating additional data structures through interaction while maintaining different data types shown and linking multiple views to form a larger connected graph.</p>

      <p>While mobile visualization is not a new concept, there is not yet much dialogue about what specifically might make this mobile visualization unique. To help trigger innovative ideas and to begin an exploration of what might be possible in mobile visualization, we propose an exploratory ideation process. This work describes our ideation, in-situ, journaling approach for exploring possibilities for visualizations on mobile devices. We present four concepts for mobile visualization and discuss the pitfalls and benefits of in-situ journaling and ideation.</p>

      <p>Evaluation is increasingly recognized as an essential component of HCI research. However, evaluation itself is a changing research area. In particular, the many variations of qualitative research are emerging as important empirical methods. This half-day tutorial is designed for beginning to intermediate audiences. We will focus on the basic methods for analyzing qualitative data using a mixture of talks and hands-on activities. In particular we will consider closed and open coding as well as clustering and categorizing coded data. After completing this tutorial, attendees will have a richer understanding of the benefits and challenges of qualitative empirical research and, more specifically, how to analyze qualitative data.</p>

      <p>Evaluation is increasingly recognized as an essential component of visualization research. However, evaluation itself is a changing research area. In particular, the many variations of qualitative research are emerging as important empirical methods. This half-day tutorial is designed for beginning to intermediate audiences. We will focus on the basic methods for analyzing qualitative data using a mixture of talks and hands-on activities. In particular we will consider closed and open coding as well as clustering and categorizing coded data. After completing this tutorial, attendees will have a richer understanding of the benefits and challenges of qualitative empirical research and, more specifically, how to analyze qualitative data.</p>

      <p>We consider the challenges and potentials for multiple views when applied in immersive analytics. The changes in physical setup of very large and possibly multiple displays, potentially combined with smaller handheld displays that can be used for both input and display augmentation, in addition to new input technologies, challenges much of current practice in multiple views. In particular: coordination techniques need to be extended for multiple views across multiple displays; we may need to re-examine task and interaction behaviour in new environments; collaboration challenges may come to the fore due to the potential for immersive technologies to provide more space for team analytics; and reconsidering our formalisms in light of these changes may prove fruitful.</p>

      <p>We explore the presentation technique of visual abstraction as a form of mediation to manage content generated by the public in order to maintain a respectful discourse. We identify technological and social mediation as two dimensions within the space of content mediation, and discuss different solutions based on related work in public interactive displays and art installations. We further discuss a novel approach to technological mediation by describing our interactive artwork Objective Meaning - an installation that invites the audience to express themselves through anonymous text messages. The design of this system mediates discourse by visually abstracting the presentation of messages on a display by breaking messages apart into decontextualized words. We briefly discuss the public response during a one-month deployment of the installation in a library setting.</p>

      <p>We explore means of designing and evaluating initial visualization ideas, with concrete and realistic data in cases where data is not readily available. Our approach is useful in exploring new domains and avenues for visualization, and contrasts other visualization work, which typically operate under the assumption that data has already been collected, and is ready to be visualized. We argue that it is sensible to understand data requirements and evaluate the potential value of visualization before devising means of automatic data collection. We base our exploration on three cases selected to span a range of factors, such as the role of the person doing the data collection and the type of instrumentation used. The three cases relate to visualizing sports, construction, and cooking domain data, and use primarily time-domain data and visualizations. For each case, we briefly describe the design case and problem, the manner in which we collected data, and the findings obtained from evaluations. Afterwards, we describe four factors of our data collection approach, and discuss potential outcomes from it.</p>

      <p>In this paper, we explore the potential of using visual representations to support people in managing, organizing, and understanding relations between multiple visualization views. Multiple views can help people understand different facets of data and data processing, and are a crucial part of data analysis particularly when it is done collaboratively. Both the growing use of multiple views and the increasing display sizes have amplified the need to explore how to better help people to understand the relations between many views. To improve our understanding of how to visualize view relations, we invited visualization and interaction designers to critique and sketch representations of view relations. The participants provided design critiques, and sketched their own relation representations. Our findings expand the range and palette of ways of visually linking visualization views and suggest new directions for designing view relation representations to better support analysis with multiple views.</p>

      <p>This paper describes a study that sought to understand elite soccer teenagers‚Äô use of information visualizations to learn about their own sports performance, how this might motivate them to change behavior, and thus potentially improve their own performance. We specifically investigate how information visualizations support the players‚Äô data comprehension, and how their level of comprehension might depend on factors such as their general literacy, visualization literacy and maturity. We show unsurprisingly that elite soccer teenagers are able to use information visualizations to gain new information about their performance. Based on our investigation, we define a classification of the level of data comprehension. Secondly, we demonstrate a method which allows visualization researchers and practitioners to design and evaluate visualization concepts based on real data over a short time-span. Finally, we argue that designers of personal information visualizations need to consider the range of visualization literacies that are to be expected in many target populations. Our lessons provide new insights in peoples‚Äô use of visualizations and more broadly in visualization literacy. From these insights, we discuss implications for design of visualizations that consider peoples‚Äô level of visualization literacy.</p>

      <p>This thesis explores information visualizations on large, high-resolution touch displays for analysis of massive amounts of data. The ever increasing rate at which data is collected about everything from peoples‚Äô health, over organisations expenditures, to scientific experiments, necessitates new data analysis techniques. Information visualizations on large, high-resolution touch displays is a promising answer to these needs, and provide abundant display space for people to make sense of data. However, little is known about how to tailor interactive visualizations to abundant display space or about the benefits they might bring. The present thesis draws on the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI) and information visualization (InfoVis) to answer these questions.</p>

      <p>People typically interact with information visualizations using a mouse. Their physical movement, orientation, and distance to visualizations are rarely used as input. We explore how to use such spatial relations among people and visualizations (i.e., proxemics) to drive interaction with visualizations, focusing here on the spatial relations between a single user and visualizations on a large display. We implement interaction techniques that zoom and pan, query and relate, and adapt visualizations based on tracking of users‚Äô position in relation to a large high-resolution display. Alternative prototypes are tested in three user studies and compared with baseline conditions that use a mouse. Our aim is to gain empirical data on the usefulness of a range of design possibilities and to generate more ideas. Among other things, the results show promise for changing zoom level or visual representation with the user‚Äôs physical distance to a large display. We discuss possible benefits and potential issues to avoid when designing information visualizations that use proxemics.</p>

      <p>Large, high-resolution displays offer new opportunities for visualizing and interacting with data. However, interaction techniques for such displays mostly support window manipulation and pointing, ignoring many activities involved in data analysis. We report on 11 workshops with data analysts from various fields, including artistic photography, phone log analysis, astrophysics, and health care policy. Analysts were asked to walk through recent tasks using actual data on a large whiteboard, imagining it to be a large display. From the resulting comments and a video analysis of behavior in the workshops, we generate ideas for new interaction techniques for large displays. These ideas include supporting sequences of visualizations with backtracking and fluid exploration of alternatives; using distance to the display to change visualizations; and fixing variables and data sets on the display or relative to the user.</p>

      <p>The traditional graphical user interface employing windows, icons, menus and pointers show weaknesses in face to face collaboration, and has done so during its lifetime. The hype of multi-touch technology marks a new and promising path for treading new lands in computer use. Tangible computing is another less hyped futuristic interaction method on the verge to mass media coverage. Discovering the differences and similarities of these two methods of interaction in face to face collaboration applications is not one possible, but needed, in order to understand, not just what to design, but how to design it. In the works, collaboration performance of the two interaction methods is held up in the light, fir everybody to perceive and evaluate the differences. It is shown, that the two interaction methods are rather collaborators than contestants ‚Äì they augment each other well, showing strengths, where the other show weaknesses. It is described how a tabletop system, which supports both methods of interaction is designed, built and used for subsequent evaluations. The possibilities of a system, utilizing these interaction methods, in design of signal processing systems in a research group, is proposed, analyzed, and evaluated ‚Äî although never fully implemented The major conclusion stemming from this work is, that that combination of multi-touch interaction and tangible computing should be experienced, in order to fully understand their possibilities. The single-most important problem facing this conclusion is, that these interaction systems don‚Äôt exist commercially yet.</p>

      <p>We describe MuZeeker, a search engine with domain knowledge based on Wikipedia. MuZeeker enables the user to refine a search in multiple steps by means of category selection. In the present version we focus on multimedia search related to music and we present two prototype search applications (web-based and mobile). A category based filtering approach enables the user to refine a search through relevance feedback by category selection instead of typing additional text, which was found to be an advantage in the mobile MuZeeker application. We report from a usability evaluation using the think aloud protocol, in which N=10 participants performed tasks using respectively MuZeeker and a customized Google search engine. The experiment gave initial indications that participants were capable of solving tasks slightly better using MuZeeker, while the "inexperienced" MuZeeker users performed slightly slower than experienced Google users. 75% of the participants reported a subjective preference for MuZeeker.</p>
