My research focuses on information visualization and human-computer interaction. I am interested in supporting people in understanding, making sense of, and discussing data in face-to-face and online contexts, for example supported by large or multiple displays and social media.

I am a Marie Curie alumni. In VIVIR, my Marie Curie Postdoctoral project, I worked with many excellent people, including
* Drs. Sheelagh Carpendale and Wesley Willett at the Interactions Lab at Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
* Dr. Kasper Hornb√¶k in the Human-Centered Computing group at Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen.
* Drs. Hude Quan and Catherine Eastwood at the Centre for Health Informatics., University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
