I just arrived at the Banff Centre for performing arts to participate in the Morbidity Reference Group (MbRG) for ICD-11. I will expand my knowledge of the coming version of the International Classification of Diseases at the same time as getting an insight look at the decision-making process.

On Wednesay, I will give a talk on Information Visualization and my work on multiple views in the VIVIR project at a related post-MbRG meeting.
