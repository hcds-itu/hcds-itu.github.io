Off to a week of inspiring talks and discussions! I am presenting my work with Dr Kasper Hornb√¶k on PADE: Supporting Collaborative Visual Analysis of Patient Administrative Systems Data with a Large Touch Display System. Dr Jagoda Walny will present our work with the NEB and VizworX on Data Changes Everything: Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Design Handoff.

We will also present three posters that I have co-authored with some great students from University of Calgary and other fine people:

* Visualizing Density of Healthcare Workers Across Time and Countries
* Comparing ICD-data Across Countries: A Case for Visualization
* Biomole: Visualizing Functional Co-Occurrence
