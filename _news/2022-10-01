# The HCDS Group is Growing
With the summer 2022 closing up shop and nature beginning to wind down, activity within the Human Centered Data Science Group (HCDS) group picks up pace. 

## New Members
As the first of 6 new members that will join the research group until the end of the year, the RA David Wegmann and PhD student Olga Yarygina joined in September and October respectively. 

## New Tech
On the equipment side, a large touch-display is now augmenting a wall in the groups meeting area, ready to be used as white board, presentation tool, and experimentation device.
