A brief stint to Glasgow, UK to meet people and discuss inspiring topics at the ACM CHI workshop on Philosophy and HCI.

I am discussing our position paper on Philosophical concerns of Visual Representation and Interaction. Sheelagh Carpendale attends another ACM CHI workshop with our position paper on Data Science Work Practices from a Ubiquitous Analytics Perspective.
