I had the pleasure of participating in the 2018 Gairdner International Symposium on November 30, 2018, hosted by the O'Brien Institute for Public Health at the University of Calgary, Foothills campus.

The focus of the symposium was on Big Data for Health, in terms of expectations, opportunities, and potential impact. I brought a poster that relates to this theme in discussing the potential for visualization and visual analytics.

I particularly enjoyed the opening keynote by Professor Alan Lopez on the history and current state of the Global Health and Burden of Disease study. Very insightful.
