Yay! More conference travel! I am attending both VIS and ISS 2017 in a few days. Also, I am participating in the immersive analytics workshop at VIS with our poster on Multiple Views and Immersive Analytics and Sarah Stoorteboom will be presenting our work on Objective Meaning (pun intended).

Also, we will do tutorials on analysing qualitative data at both IEEE VIS 2017 and later in October, at ACM ISS 2017.
