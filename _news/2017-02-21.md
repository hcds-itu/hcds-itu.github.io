I have recently been informed that I had been fortunate to receieve a Marie Curie postdoctoral grant for my VIVIR (short for VIsualizing VIew Relations) project application to work with Professor Sheelagh Carpendale (University of Calgary) and Kasper Hornb√¶k (University of Copenhagen) for three full years!

The first two years, I will be spending in the iLab at the Computer Science department of University of Calgary, Canada. The third year, I will return to Europe and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

The topic of my work is to increase our understanding of the notion of multiple views in visualization, bridging a theoretical foundation with concrete application examples in health data analysis and ubiqoutous collaborative analytics.
